## New features

### Business address and billing address separation

You can now have multiple credit cards with different billing addresses. See [Billing and payments]({{< relref "/operate/rc/billing-and-payments" >}}) to learn how to add a new credit card.

Your account now also has a **Business address**, which you can find in [Account settings]({{< relref "/operate/rc/accounts/account-settings" >}}).

## Enhancements

### Redis Cloud Bring your own Cloud

AWS Cloud Accounts are now known as Redis Cloud Bring your own Cloud (BYOC). See [Redis Cloud Bring your own Cloud]({{< relref "/operate/rc/subscriptions/bring-your-own-cloud" >}}) to learn how to use your own AWS cloud infrastructure to deploy Redis Cloud.
