## New features

### Business address and billing address separation

You can now have multiple credit cards with different billing addresses. See [Billing and payments]({{< relref "/operate/rc/billing-and-payments" >}}) to learn how to add a new credit card.

Your account now also has a **Business address**, which can be found in [Account settings]({{< relref "/operate/rc/accounts/account-settings" >}}).
