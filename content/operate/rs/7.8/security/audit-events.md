Starting with version 6.2.18, Redis Enterprise Software lets you audit database connection and authentication events.  This helps you track and troubleshoot connection activity.

The following events are tracked:

- Database connection attempts
- Authentication requests, including requests for new and existing connections
- Database disconnects

When tracked events are triggered, notifications are sent via TCP to an address and port defined when auditing is enabled.  Notifications appear in near real time and are intended to be consumed by an external listener, such as a TCP listener, third-party service, or related utility.

Example external listeners include:

- [`ncat`](https://nmap.org/ncat/): useful for debugging but not suitable for production environments.

- Imperva Sonar: a third-party service available for purchase separately from Redis Enterprise Software. See [Redis Onboarding Steps](https://docs.imperva.com/bundle/onboarding-databases-to-sonar-reference-guide/page/Redis-Onboarding-Steps_48368215.html) for more information.

For development and testing environments, notifications can be saved to a local file; however, this is neither supported nor intended for production environments.

For performance reasons, auditing is not enabled by default.  In addition, auditing occurs in the background (asynchronously) and is non-blocking by design.  That is, the action that triggered the notification continues without regard to the status of the notification or the listening tool.  

## Enable audit notifications

### Cluster audits

To enable auditing for your cluster, use:

- `rladmin`

    ```
    rladmin cluster config auditing db_conns \
       audit_protocol <TCP|local> \
       audit_address <address> \
       audit_port <port> \
       audit_reconnect_interval <interval in seconds> \
       audit_reconnect_max_attempts <number of attempts>
    ```

    where:

    - _audit\_protocol_ indicates the protocol used to process notifications.  For production systems, _TCP_ is the only value. 

    - _audit\_address_ defines the TCP/IP address where one can listen for notifications

    - _audit\_port_ defines the port where one can listen for notifications
   
    - _audit\_reconnect\_interval_ defines the interval (in seconds) between attempts to reconnect to the listener. Default is 1 second.
    
    - _audit\_reconnect\_max\_attempts_ defines the maximum number of attempts to reconnect. Default is 0. (infinite)

    Development systems can set _audit\_protocol_ to `local` for testing and training purposes; however, this setting is _not_ supported for production use.  
    
    When `audit_protocol` is set to `local`, `<address>` should be set to a [stream socket](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/unix.7.html) defined on the machine running Redis Enterprise and _`<port>`_ should not be specified: 
    
    ```
    rladmin cluster config auditing db_conns \
       audit_protocol local audit_address <output-file>
    ```

    The output file (and path) must be accessible by the user and group running Redis Enterprise Software.

- the [REST API]({{< relref "/operate/rs/7.8/references/rest-api/requests/cluster/auditing-db-conns#put-cluster-audit-db-conns" >}})

    ```
    PUT /v1/cluster/auditing/db_conns
    { 
        "audit_address": "<address>", 
        "audit_port": <port>, 
        "audit_protocol": "TCP",
        "audit_reconnect_interval": <interval>,
        "audit_reconnect_max_attempts": <max attempts>
    }
    ```

    where `<address>` is a string containing the TCP/IP address, `<port>` is a numeric value representing the port, `<interval>` is a numeric value representing the interval in seconds, and `<max attempts>` is a numeric value representing the maximum number of attempts to execute.

### Database audits

Once auditing is enabled for your cluster, you can audit individual databases.  To do so, use:

- `rladmin`

    ```
    rladmin tune db db:<id|name> db_conns_auditing enabled
    ```

    where the value of the _db:_ parameter is either the cluster ID of the database or the database name.

    To deactivate auditing, set `db_conns_auditing` to `disabled`.

    Use `rladmin info` to retrieve additional details:

    ```
    rladmin info db <id|name>
    rladmin info cluster
    ```

- the [REST API]({{< relref "/operate/rs/7.8/references/rest-api/requests/bdbs#put-bdbs" >}})

    ```
    PUT /v1/bdbs/1
    { "db_conns_auditing": true }
    ```

    To deactivate auditing, set `db_conns_auditing` to `false`.

You must enable auditing for your cluster before auditing a database; otherwise, an error appears:

>  _Error setting description: Unable to enable DB Connections Auditing before feature configurations are set.                                                                                                  
>  Error setting error_code: db_conns_auditing_config_missing_

To resolve this error, enable the protocol for your cluster _before_ attempting to audit a database.

### Policy defaults for new databases

To audit connections for new databases by default, use:

- `rladmin`

    ```
    rladmin tune cluster db_conns_auditing enabled
    ```

    To deactivate this policy, set `db_conns_auditing` to `disabled`.

- the [REST API]({{< relref "/operate/rs/7.8/references/rest-api/requests/cluster/policy#put-cluster-policy" >}})

    ```
    PUT /v1/cluster/policy
    { "db_conns_auditing": true }
    ```

    To deactivate this policy, set `db_conns_auditing` to `false`.

## Notification examples

Audit event notifications are reported as JSON objects.

### New connection

This example reports a new connection for a database:

``` json
{
    "ts":1655821384,
    "new_conn":
    {
        "id":2285001002 ,
        "srcip":"127.0.0.1",
        "srcp":"39338",
        "trgip":"127.0.0.1",
        "trgp":"12635",
        "hname":"",
        "bdb_name":"DB1",
        "bdb_uid":"5"
    }
}
```

### Authentication request

Here is a sample authentication request for a database:

``` json
{
    "ts":1655821384,
    "action":"auth",
    "id":2285001002 ,
    "srcip":"127.0.0.1",
    "srcp":"39338",
    "trgip":"127.0.0.1",
    "trgp":"12635",
    "hname":"",
    "bdb_name":"DB1",
    "bdb_uid":"5",
    "status":2,
    "username":"user_one",
    "identity":"user:1",
    "acl-rules":"~* +@all"
}
```

The `status` field reports the following: 

- Values of 2, 7, or 8 indicate success.

- Values of 3 or 5 indicate that the client authentication is in progress and should conclude later.

- Other values indicate failures.

### Database disconnect

Here's what's reported when a database connection is closed:

``` json
{
    "ts":1655821384,
    "close_conn":
    {
        "id":2285001002,
        "srcip":"127.0.0.1",
        "srcp":"39338",
        "trgip":"127.0.0.1",
        "trgp":"12635",
        "hname":"",
        "bdb_name":"DB1",
        "bdb_uid":"5"
    }
}
```

## Notification field reference

The field value that appears immediately after the timestamp describes the action that triggered the notification.  The following values may appear:

- `new_conn` indicates a new external connection
- `new_int_conn` indicates a new internal connection 
- `close_conn` occurs when a connection is closed
- `"action":"auth"` indicates an authentication request and can refer to new authentication requests or authorization checks on existing connections

In addition, the following fields may also appear in audit event notifications:

| Field&nbsp;name | Description |
|:---------:|-------------|
| `acl-rules` | ACL rules associated with the connection, which includes a rule for the `default` user. |
| `bdb_name` | Destination database name - The name of the database being accessed. | 
| `bdb_uid` | Destination database ID - The cluster ID of the database being accessed. | 
| `hname` | Client hostname - The hostname of the client.  Currently empty; reserved for future use. |
| `id` | Connection ID - Unique connection ID assigned by the proxy. |
| `identity` | Identity - A unique ID the proxy assigned to the user for the current connection. |
| `srcip` | Source IP address - Source TCP/IP address of the client accessing the Redis database. |
| `srcp` | Source port - Port associated with the source IP address accessing the Redis database. Combine the port with the address to uniquely identify the socket. |
| `status` | Status result code - An integer representing the result of an authentication request. |
| `trgip` | Target IP address - The IP address of the destination being accessed by the action. |
| `trgp` | Target port - The port of the destination being accessed by the action.  Combine the port with the destination IP address to uniquely identify the database being accessed. |
| `ts`  | Timestamp - The date and time of the event, in [Coordinated Universal Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time) (UTC).  Granularity is within one second. |
| `username` | Authentication username  - Username associated with the connection; can include `default` for databases that allow default access.  (Passwords are _not_ recorded). |

## Status result codes

The `status` field reports the results of an authentication request as an integer.  Here's what different values mean:

| Error&nbsp;value | Error code | Description | 
|:-------------:|------------|-------------|
| `0` | AUTHENTICATION_FAILED | Invalid username and/or password. |
| `1` | AUTHENTICATION_FAILED_TOO_LONG | Username or password are too long. |
| `2` | AUTHENTICATION_NOT_REQUIRED | Client tried to authenticate, but authentication isn't necessary. | 
| `3` | AUTHENTICATION_DIRECTORY_PENDING | Attempting to receive authentication info from the directory in async mode. |
| `4` | AUTHENTICATION_DIRECTORY_ERROR | Authentication attempt failed because there was a directory connection error. |
| `5` | AUTHENTICATION_SYNCER_IN_PROGRESS | Syncer SASL handshake. Return SASL response and wait for the next request. | 
| `6` | AUTHENTICATION_SYNCER_FAILED | Syncer SASL handshake. Returned SASL response and closed the connection. |
| `7` | AUTHENTICATION_SYNCER_OK | Syncer authenticated. Returned SASL response. |
| `8` | AUTHENTICATION_OK | Client successfully authenticated. |
